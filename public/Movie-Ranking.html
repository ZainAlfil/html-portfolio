 <h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>Cast Away</h3>
 <p>is a movie played by Tom Hanks where he survives a plane crash and lives on an isolated island for four years, it shows how he survives by living a very primitive lifestyle, fishes using hand crafted tools, and makes a friend called willson out of a ball.</p>
 <h3>Matrix</h3>
 <p>one of my best experiences with this movie is that i have watched it several times, but one of the times i was watching it alone and then the idea of the movie kicked in.. so what happened is that i was feeling mentally superior on the next day that i overcame physical obstacles, and achieved some stuff in one day that required at least three days.</p>
 <h3>Lion</h3>
 <p>is a movie about an Indian/Bangali kid who goes out with his brother and the big brother leaves that kid behind then the child goes lost.. (i don't wanna spoil it for you, but two things to know: it's based on real story, and it's a great movie!!)</p>
